# quick-mysql-js

Utility methods for quickly starting up a mysql container. Useful for when you're testing code that depends on a mysql databases.

[`quick-mysql-js`](https://github.com/windyroad/quick-mysql-js) uses [`dockerode`](https://github.com/apocas/dockerode) and you need to install it as a peer dependency

# Why

Sometimes I need a mysql database for the code I'm testing to connect to. The easiest way to make sure one is available is to pull the relevant Docker image and start up a container. This code tries to make that quick and easy.

# Installation

```
npm install @windyroad/quick-mysql-js dockerode --save-dev
```

# Usage

## ensureMySqlStarted(docker, version = 'latest', port = '3306', timeout = 60000, password = 'my-secret-pw', env = [])

ensureStarted will start try to start a msql container. It returns a promise that resolves when a connection can be made to to container on the specified port.

```js

import qc from '@windyroad/quick-containers-js'
import qmysql from '@windyroad/quick-mysql-js'
import Docker from 'dockerode'
import waitport from 'wait-port'
...

const docker = new Docker();
qc.ensurePulled(docker, 'mysql:5.7.26')
  .then(() => {
    return qmysql.ensureMySqlStarted(docker, '5.7.26', PORT_B)
    // ðŸ‘†same as qm.ensureMySqlStarted(Docker,  '5.7.26', PORT_B, 60000, 'my-secret-pw', []);
  })
  .then(...)
  .catch(...)

```
